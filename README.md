# Project-Guido
Major Project undertaken in Prototyping Interactive Systems Course(IIITD Monsoon 2019 Semester)

It is a novel inventory management system that blends industrial rigor with unparalleled simplicity.

The inventory management system was controlled using an app developed on MIT AppInventor. All the communication between the app and the system was using bluetooth. For the internal functioning of the system, Arduino was used as the preferred Micro processor.

The code for Arduino is present in the .ino file and the package for the app is present in the .aia file
